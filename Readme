### These instruction are for Mac (I have not tried it on Windows, should be the same):

- Install Visul Studio 2022 for Mac, I have used version 17.6. You can get it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)
- Other option is to install .net7 sdk( you can find it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0). Run dotnet --version, and make sure you get 7.x.x response

#### Using Visual studio
- Run the app from the IDE 
- Run the tests from the test explorer

#### Using command line
- To run the app, change to PhotoApp/PhotoApp directory and run the command ``dotnet run``
- To run the tests, change to PhotoAlbum/PhotoAlbum.Test directory and run the command ``dotnet test``
